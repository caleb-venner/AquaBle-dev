# TODO

## General -

- When new light automode config is sent and saved --> dynamic reload of device card and settings window.
- Onboarding process: Load in doser settings from payload decoding. Easier than redoing schedules.
- Need to decide when/what triggers a payload status request from devies
- refactor create_light_config_from_command;  "brightness", "multi_channel_brightness", to one function.

## Nice to have

- Allow users to reverse integrate hassio plugs/switches etc. Can control them from aquable scenes.
  i.e., control co2 solenoid.
