# TODO

## General -

- When new light automode config is sent and saved --> dynamic reload of device card and settings window.
- Onboarding process: Load in doser settings from payload decoding. Easier than redoing schedules.
- Need to decide when/what triggers a payload status request from devies

## Nice to have

- Allow users to reverse integrate hassio plugs/switches etc. Can control them from aquable scenes.
