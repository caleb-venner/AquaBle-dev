# Development Priorities & Improvement Plan

## Current Priorities

### 1. Testing & Quality Assurance (HIGH PRIORITY)

#### Wattage Calculator Testing

The complex wattage calculation logic needs comprehensive unit tests covering edge cases, power limiting scenarios, and multi-channel calculations.

Implementation Plan:
- Set up Jest or Vitest testing framework for frontend
- Create comprehensive test cases with >90% code coverage
- Add tests to CI/CD pipeline

#### Backend Testing Expansion

- Mock BLE device integration tests
- API endpoint validation tests
- Error handling and timeout scenarios

### 2. Performance & Bundle Optimization (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

#### Current Bundle Analysis

- Main bundle: ~15KB (good for SPA)
- Modern device card module: ~17KB
- Total compressed: ~64KB

#### Optimization Opportunities

- Code splitting: Separate dev tools from main dashboard
- Tree shaking: Remove unused utility functions
- Lazy loading: Load test tools on demand

### 3. Developer Experience (LOW PRIORITY)

#### Testing Infrastructure

- Set up component testing for UI modules
- Integration tests for API endpoints

#### Development Tools

- Add TypeScript strict mode configuration
- Implement proper linting rules
- Add bundle analyzer for size monitoring

## Next Steps Recommendation

**Week 1-2**: Focus on wattage calculator testing
**Week 3-4**: Backend testing expansion
**Month 2+**: Performance optimizations and advanced features

The codebase is in excellent shape - these improvements will make it even more maintainable and robust for future development.
