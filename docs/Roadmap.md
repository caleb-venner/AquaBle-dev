# Roadmap

## **Nice to Have**, features

- Create device groups that can share scenes and settings.
- Add favorite settings or 'Scenes' for light devices and groups.
- Track dosed volume against 'container' object and expose to UI and Home Assistant.
- Expand device model names in the backend to include full specifications (e.g., size --> WRGB II Pro 120cm).
- Implement a first-time setup wizard for new devices? Would need to warn the end user that the device(s) will have all settings 'reset'.
- Create virtual devices for testing different hardware configurations.
- Consider implementing versioning for device configurations.
