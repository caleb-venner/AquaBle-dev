## Requirements

- Device with Bluetooth LE support
- [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (for local installation)
- Compatible Chihiros devices within Bluetooth range

## Quick Start

### Home Assistant Add-on
```yaml
# Add-on configuration
log_level: INFO
auto_discover: false
auto_reconnect: true
```

### Docker
```bash
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

### Local Installation

Install the package and launch the bundled FastAPI/Uvicorn entrypoint:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .

chihiros-service
```

Environment variables `AQUA_BLE_SERVICE_HOST` and `AQUA_BLE_SERVICE_PORT`
override the default listen address (`0.0.0.0:8000`). Once running, visit
`http://localhost:8000/` for the TypeScript dashboard. If the SPA has not yet
been built (or a Vite dev server is not running), the root route will return a
503 with instructions on how to start the frontend build. All capabilities
remain exposed under the `/api/*` endpoints.

### First run and device discovery

On a fresh start (no cached devices), the dashboard shows a simple onboarding panel with a "Scan for devices" button. Use it to discover nearby supported devices and click "Connect" to add them to the service cache.

Equivalent REST endpoints are available if you prefer scripts:

- `GET /api/scan` ‚Üí returns a list of nearby supported devices: address, name, product, device_type
- `POST /api/devices/{address}/connect` ‚Üí connects to the device and captures an initial status

Optional automation: set `AQUA_BLE_AUTO_DISCOVER=1` to perform a one-off scan at startup (only when there are no cached devices) and attempt to connect to supported devices automatically.

```bash
# Disable auto-discover when launching both servers
make dev AQUA_BLE_AUTO_DISCOVER=0

# Run just the backend with auto-discover disabled/enabled explicitly
make dev-back AQUA_BLE_AUTO_DISCOVER=0
make dev-back AQUA_BLE_AUTO_DISCOVER=1
```

## Frontend development (TypeScript SPA)

The project now ships with an experimental SPA scaffold under the
`frontend/` directory. It consumes the same REST endpoints exposed by the
FastAPI service.

Install dependencies and launch the Vite dev server (proxying API requests to
the Python backend running on port 8000):

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

With the development server running, visiting `http://localhost:8000/` will
transparently proxy requests to Vite (listening on port 5173 by default).
Point `AQUA_BLE_FRONTEND_DEV` at a different origin if the dev server is
hosted elsewhere, or set it to `0` to disable the proxy. When both the proxy
and compiled assets are unavailable the backend now returns a `503` response
reminding you to start the SPA build.

The old HTMX templates have now been archived from the service. Requests to
`/ui` or `/debug` will return `410 Gone`; use the SPA or REST API instead.

Create a production build before packaging or running inside Docker:

```bash
npm run build
```

By default the FastAPI app serves the compiled bundle from
`frontend/dist`. If the assets live elsewhere, point the service at the
correct directory via the `AQUA_BLE_FRONTEND_DIST` environment variable.

### Service runtime tuning

The service performs a brief wait after issuing a BLE status request to
allow notification frames to arrive before reading the device's
`last_status`. This delay defaults to `1.5` seconds but can be tuned via
the environment variable:

```bash
export AQUA_BLE_STATUS_WAIT=0.8  # seconds
```

Lowering the value can make successive manual refreshes faster but risks
capturing an incomplete status frame on slower adapters or noisy RF
environments. Increasing it slightly may help if you observe intermittent
"No status received" errors when polling devices.

## Environment Variables

Centralized reference for runtime configuration knobs exposed by the service / SPA integration.

| Variable | Default | Type | Purpose | Example |
|----------|---------|------|---------|---------|
| `AQUA_BLE_SERVICE_HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | str | Listen interface for the FastAPI/Uvicorn server. | `127.0.0.1` |
| `AQUA_BLE_SERVICE_PORT` | `8000` | int | Listen port for the FastAPI/Uvicorn server. | `9000` |
| `AQUA_BLE_AUTO_RECONNECT` | `1` | int/bool | Attempt reconnect to previously cached devices on startup (`1` truthy, `0` disabled). | `0` |
| `AQUA_BLE_AUTO_DISCOVER` | `0` | int/bool | When no cached devices exist, perform a one-off scan at startup and try to connect to supported devices automatically. | `1` |
| `AQUA_BLE_STATUS_WAIT` | `1.5` | float (s) | Delay after requesting a status before reading cached frame (tune for adapter speed / RF conditions). | `0.8` |
| `AQUA_BLE_FRONTEND_DEV` | (unset) | str/URL | If set, root path proxies to a running Vite dev server instead of serving built assets. Set to `0` to force-disable proxy even if assets missing. | `http://localhost:5173` |
| `AQUA_BLE_FRONTEND_DIST` | `frontend/dist` | path | Absolute/relative path to built SPA assets (index.html + assets/). | `/opt/app/frontend-build` |
| `AQUA_BLE_LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | str | Logging verbosity for service logger (standard Python levels). | `DEBUG` |
| `AQUA_BLE_CONFIG_DIR` | `~/.aqua-ble` | path | Configuration directory for device state and profiles. | `~/.config/aqua-ble` |

**Migration Note:** Old environment variable names (`CHIHIROS_*`) are still supported for backward compatibility through automatic fallback. New projects should use the `AQUA_BLE_*` prefix.

Notes:

- Boolean style variables accept `0/1`, `true/false`, `yes/no`, or `on/off` (case-insensitive). Invalid or empty values fall back to the documented default.
- Auto-discover runs only when the cache is empty (first run) to avoid interrupting existing connections.
- `AQUA_BLE_STATUS_WAIT` invalid (non-float) values fall back to the default at import time.
- When both a dev server proxy and a local dist are unavailable the root route returns HTTP 503 with guidance.
- Changes to these variables require a service restart to take effect (they are read at module import or startup).
- Configuration directory migration: If `~/.chihiros/` exists and `~/.aqua-ble/` doesn't, configs are automatically migrated to the new location on first startup.

## Docker usage

Build and run the service inside a container:

```bash
docker build -t chihiros-service .

docker run \
  --rm \
  --name chihiros-service \
  --net=host \
  --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
  --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN \
  --device /dev/bus/usb \
  chihiros-service
```

Containerised BLE access often requires forwarding the host adapter or
running with elevated capabilities; adjust the `docker run` flags to suit
your environment.

## Protocol

The vendor app uses Bluetooth LE to communicate with the LED. The LED advertises a UART service with the UUID `6E400001-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E`. This service contains a RX characteristic with the UUID `6E400002-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E`. This characteristic can be used to send commands to the LED. The LED will respond to commands by sending a notification to the corresponding TX service with the UUID `6E400003-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E`.

The commands are sent as a byte array with the following structure:

| Command ID | 1 | Command Length | Message ID High | Message ID Low | Mode | Parameters | Checksum |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

The checksum is calculated by XORing all bytes of the command together. The checksum is then added to the command as the last byte.

The message id is a 16 bit number that is incremented with each command. It is split into two bytes. The first byte is the high byte and the second byte is the low byte.

The command length is the number of parameters + 5.

### Manual Mode

The LED can be set to a specific brightness by sending the following command with the following options:

- Command ID: **90**
- Mode: **7**
- Parameters: [ **Color** (0-2), **Brightness** (0 - 100)]

On non-RGB models, the color parameter should be set to 0 to indicate white. On RGB models, each color's brightness is sent as a separate command. Red is 0, green is 1, blue is 2.

### Auto Mode

To switch to auto mode, the following command can be used:

- Command ID: **90**
- Mode: **5**
- Parameters: [ **18**, **255**, **255** ]

With auto mode enabled, the LED can be set to automatically turn on and off at a specific time. The following command can be used to create a new setting:

- Command ID: **165**
- Mode: **25**
- Parameters: [ **sunrise hour**, **sunrise minutes**, **sunset hour**, **sunset minutes**, **ramp up minutes**, **weekdays**, **red brightness**, **green brightness**, **blue brightness**, 5x **255** ]

The weekdays are encoded as a sequence of 7 bits with the following structure: `Monday Thuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday`. A bit is set to 1 if the LED should be on on that day. It is only possible to set one setting per day i.e. no conflicting settings. There is also a maximum of 7 settings.

On non-RGB models, the desired brightness should be set as the red brightness while the other two colors should be set to **255**.

To deactivate a setting, the same command can be used but the brightness has to be set to **255**.

#### Set Time

The current time is required for auto mode and can be set by sending the following command:

- Command ID: **90**
- Mode: **9**
- Parameters: [ **year - 2000**, **month**, **weekday**, **hour**, **minute**, **second** ]

- Weekday is 1 - 7 for Monday - Sunday

#### Reset Auto Mode Settings

The auto mode and its settings can be reset by sending the following command:

- Command ID: **90**
- Mode: **5**
- Parameters: [ **5**, **255**, **255** ]
